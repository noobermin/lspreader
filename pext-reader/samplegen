This is a tutorial for reading pext planes using this reader.
The basic flow of it is demonstrated by the simple case of
a single run with no restarts.

Copy the pext files to a directory, and place script like this
in that directory, with pext.py, dictcat.py, and angular.py linked
in the directory as well

Essentially, we call the script \"pext.py\" which converts the p4's to
oext files, which are just dictionaries of the data in the p4.

Right now, I'm not smart enough to scan the p4 files. I assume they are 2D,
with x and z dimensions.

Now, let's look:
"
ls -la | grep p4.d
echo "
The generated files (shown here) that I've artificially have given .d
suffixes are basically dictionaries of each pext plane's captured particles.
"
waitforit
echo "

One more admonishment. We can concatenate the files by using dictcat.py"
echo \$ ./dictcat.py *.d \>pext.pi
./dictcat.py *.d>pext.pi
echo "
Now, we created a new file
"

ls -la | grep '\(p4.d\|pext.pi\)'

echo "
which essentially contains the particles from all pext planes."

echo "

Finally, as a demonstration, I am going to call angular.py on the cat'd file.
This shows a momentum angle vs. energy vs. charge plot. This demonstrates how you
can use the .d and .pi files. Of course, they are plain dictionaries with plain
numpy arrays, so you're free to plot them up in anyway you like.

Exiting the angular.py script will exit this tutorial."
