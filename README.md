lspreader
=========

A set of readers for the plasma code LSP's outputs.

For reading pext (<b>p</b>article <b>ext</b>raction) files and creating the angular plot, see `pext-reader/`

Prerequisites
-------------

Currently, the only prequisite that these scripts generally need is `docopt`, which you can find through `pip` or your package manager. Docopt is awesome, you shame on you if you don't have it already :)
